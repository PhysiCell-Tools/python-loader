# mcds.get_muspan()


## input:
```
    z_slice: floating point number; default is None
        z-axis position to slice a 2D xy-plain out of the
        3D mesh. if None the whole 3D mesh will be returned.

    values: integer; default is 1
        minimal number of values a variable has to have to be outputted.
        variables that have only 1 state carry no information.
        None is a state too.

    drop: set of strings; default is an empty set
        set of column labels to be dropped for the dataframe.
        don't worry: essential columns like ID, coordinates
        and time will never be dropped.
        Attention: when the keep parameter is given, then
        the drop parameter has to be an empty set!

    keep: set of strings; default is an empty set
        set of column labels to be kept in the dataframe.
        set values=1 to be sure that all variables are kept.
        don't worry: essential columns like ID, coordinates
        and time will always be kept.

```

## output:
```
    do_domain:  dictionary of muspa domains, one for each z-layer.

```

## description:
```
    function returns a dictionary of muspa domains, containg a
    cell and subs collection with disrcete and continuous labels
    and all the graph as networks.
