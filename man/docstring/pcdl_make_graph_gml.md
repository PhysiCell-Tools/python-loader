                           [path] [graph_type]

function to generate graph files in the gml graph modelling language standard
format. gml was the outcome of an initiative that started at the international
symposium on graph drawing 1995 in Passau and ended at Graph Drawing 1996 in
Berkeley. the networkx python library (https://networkx.org/) and igraph C and
python libraries (https://igraph.org/) for graph analysis are gml compatible
and can as such read and write this file format.

positional arguments:
  path                  path to the PhysiCell output directory or a
                        outputnnnnnnnn.xml file. default is . .
  graph_type            to specify which physicell output data should be
                        processed. attached: processes
                        mcds.get_attached_graph_dict dictionary. neighbor:
                        processes mcds.get_neighbor_graph_dict dictionary
                        spring: processes mcds.get_spring_graph_dict
                        dictionary.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --custom_data_type [CUSTOM_DATA_TYPE ...]
                        parameter to specify custom_data variable types other
                        than float (namely: int, bool, str) like this
                        var:dtype myint:int mybool:bool mystr:str . downstream
                        float and int will be handled as numeric, bool as
                        Boolean, and str as categorical data. default is an
                        empty string.
  --microenv MICROENV   should the microenvironment data be loaded? setting
                        microenv to False will use less memory and speed up
                        processing, similar to the original pyMCDS_cells.py
                        script. default is True.
  --physiboss PHYSIBOSS
                        if found, should physiboss state data be extracted and
                        loaded into the df_cell dataframe? default is True.
  --settingxml SETTINGXML
                        the settings.xml that is loaded, from which the cell
                        type ID label mapping, is extracted, if this
                        information is not found in the output xml file. set
                        to None or False if the xml file is missing! default
                        is PhysiCell_settings.xml.
  -v VERBOSE, --verbose VERBOSE
                        setting verbose to False for less text output, while
                        processing. default is True.
  --edge_attribute EDGE_ATTRIBUTE
                        specifies if the spatial Euclidean distance is used
                        for edge attribute, to generate a weighted graph.
                        default is True.
  --node_attribute [NODE_ATTRIBUTE ...]
                        listing of mcds.get_cell_df dataframe columns, used
                        for node attributes. default is and empty list.
