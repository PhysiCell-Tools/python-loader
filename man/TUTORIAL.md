### Introduction: PhysiCell's MultiCellular Data Standard (MCDS) Time Step Anatomy

Each time PhysiCell's internal time tracker passes a time step where data is to be saved, it generates a number of files of various types.\
Each of these files will have a number at the end that indicates where it belongs in the sequence of outputs.\
All files from the first round of output will end in 00000000.\*, and the second round will be 00000001.\*, and so on.\
Have a look at this [PhysiCell data time series](https://github.com/elmbeech/physicelldataloader/tree/master/pcdl/data_timeseries_2d).

Let's assume we captured data every simulation time hour, and we're interested in the set of output half a day through the run, the 13th set of output files.\
The files we care about most from this set consists of:

+ **output00000012.xml**: This file is the main organizer of the data.
    It contains an overview of the data stored in the MultiCellDS as well as some actual data, including:\
    metadata (MultiCellDS version, PhysiCell or BioFVM version, simulation time, runtime, and processing time stamp),\
    coordinates for the computational domain (mesh),\
    parameters for diffusing substrates in the microenvironment (continuum\_variables),\
    column labels and units for the cell data (cell\_population),\
    file names for the files that contain microenvironment and cell data at this time step (mat and possibly graph.txt files),
+ **output00000012_cells.mat**: This is a MATLAB matrix file that contains tracked information about the individual cells in the model.
    It tells us things like the cells' position, volume, secretion, cell cycle status, and user defined cell parameters.
+ **output00000012_microenvironment0.mat**: This is a MATLAB matrix file that contains data about the microenvironment at this time step.


### The Legacy Way to Run pyMCDS

In the early days, PhysiCell output was with the help of a script loaded into MATLAB for analysis.\
In 2019, a similar loader script was written for phython3.
The name of this script filed was pyMCDS.py.
To load data, this file was copied into the PhysiCell root or output folder.
A python3 shell was fired up in the directory where this file resisted, and the pyMCDS class was loaded with this code line below.

```python
# legacy way to load the pyMCDS class
from pyMCDS import pyMCDS
```

In autumn 2022 an endeavor was undertaken to pack this pyMCDS.py script into a pip installable python3 library and develop it further, but always in such a way that, if necessary, the code could still be run like in the early days.

All this resulted in the PhysiCell data loader (pcdl) library here.

If you inspect today's pcdl source code, you will see that the [pyMCDS.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elmbeech/physicelldataloader/master/pcdl/pyMCDS.py) file still exists.
And if you feel so, it is still possible to load PhysiCell output the ancient way!

the pyMCDS class as such evolved into the TimeStep class, which is more powerful although it has heavier library dependencies too.


### Loading an MCDS into Python3

In this section, we will load the pcdl library and use its TimeStep class to load the data snapshot 00000012, described above, from [data\_timeseries\_ 2d](https://github.com/elmbeech/physicelldataloader/tree/master/pcdl/data_timeseries_2d) from the 2D time series test dataset.

```python
import pathlib  # library to locate the test data
import pcdl  # the physicell data loader library

print('pcdl version:', pcdl.__version__)  # it is easy to figure out which pcdl version you run

pcdl.install_data()  # to install the test datasets

s_path = str(pathlib.Path(pcdl.__file__).parent.joinpath('data_timeseries_2d'))  # local path to the installed test data set
s_file = 'output00000012.xml'  # the snapshot we want to analyze
s_pathfile = f'{s_path}/{s_file}'
print('mcds xml:', s_pathfile)

# load mcds - multi cell data standard - object
mcds = pcdl.TimeStep(s_pathfile)  # loads the whole snapshot: the xml and all related mat and graph files
```

Side note: for path, in general, unix (slash) and windows (backslash) notation will work.

The legacy way of loading data, where filename and path had to be separated, works too.

```python
# legacy way of loading a mcds object
mcds = pcdl.TimeStep('output00000012.xml', s_path)
```

By default, all data related to the snapshot is loaded.\
For speed and less memory usage, it is however possible to only load the essential (output xml and cell mat data), and exclude microenvironment, graph data, and ID label mapping loading.\
Additionally, it is possible to specify for custom\_data variable types other than the generic float type, namely: int, bool, and str.

```python
# fine tuned way of loading a mcds object
mcds = pcdl.TimeStep(s_pathfile, custom_type={}, microenv=False, graph=False, settingxml=None)
```


### The Loaded Data Structure

```python
# fetch data
mcds = pcdl.TimeStep(s_pathfile)
```

All loaded data lives in `mcds.data` dictionary.\
As in **version 1**, we have tried to keep everything organized inside this dictionary.\
Regarding **version 1**, the structure has slightly changed.\
However, in **version 3**, all data is accessible by functions. There should be no need to fetch data directly from the `mcds.data` dictionary!\
Anyhow, let's take a look at what we actually have in here.

![mcds.data dictionary blueprint](img/physicelldataloader_data_dictionary_v3.2.2.png)

```python
# main data branches
sorted(mcds.data.keys())  # metadata, mesh, substrate (continuum_variables), and agent (discrete_cells)

# metadata
sorted(mcds.data['metadata'].keys())  # multicellds version, physicell version, simulation time, runtime, time stamp, time unit, spatial unit, and substrate and cell type ID label mappings

# mesh
sorted(mcds.data['mesh'].keys())  # voxel (ijk), mesh (nmp), and position (xyz) range, axis, coordinate, grid objects, and voxel volume

# microenvironment
sorted(mcds.data['continuum_variables'].keys())  # list of all processed substrates, e.g. oxygen
sorted(mcds.data['continuum_variables']['oxygen'].keys())  # substrate related data values, unit, diffusion coefficient, and decay rate

# cell
sorted(mcds.data['discrete_cells'].keys())  # data, units, and graph dictionaries
sorted(mcds.data['discrete_cells']['data'].keys())  # all cell related, tracked data
sorted(mcds.data['discrete_cells']['units'].keys())  # all units from the cell related, tracked data
sorted(mcds.data['discrete_cells']['graph'].keys())  # neighbor_cells and attached_cells graph dictionaries
```


### Accessing the Loaded Data by the TimeStep Class Functions
Once again, loud, for the ones in the back, in version 3, all data is accessible by functions.\
There should be no need to fetch data directly from the `mcds.data` dictionary of dictionaries.\
We will explore these functions in this section.

```python
# fetch data
mcds = pcdl.TimeStep(s_pathfile)
```

#### Metadata

Fetch the data's MultiCellDS version, and the PhysiCell version the data was generated.

```python
mcds.get_multicellds_version()  # will return a string like MultiCellDS_2 or MultiCellDS_0.5
mcds.get_physicell_version()  # will return a string like PhysiCell_1.10.4 or BioFVM_1.1.7
```

Fetch simulation time, runtime, and time stamp when the data was processed.

```python
mcds.get_time()   # will return a float value like 720.0
mcds.get_runtime()  # will return a float value like 15.596373
mcds.get_timestamp()  # will return a sting like 2022-10-19T01:12:01Z
```

Fetch substrate and cell type ID label mappings, read out from the PhysiCell\_settings.xml file.

```python
mcds.get_substrate_dict()  # will return a dictionary, which maps substrate IDs to labels
mcds.get_celltype_dict()   # will return a dictionary, which maps cell type IDs to labels
```


#### Mesh Data

Let's start by the voxel.\
It is common, but not necessary, that the voxel's width, height, and depth is the same.\
However, you will find that in this test dataset this is not the case. \
In the related `PhysiCell_settings.xml` file the voxel was specified as 30[nm] high, 20[nm] wide, and 10[nm] deep.\
We can retrieve this voxel spacing value and voxel volume. \
Additionally, we can retrieve the mesh spacing.\
You will notice that voxel and mesh spacing values differ.\
This is because this data set is from a 2D simulation. For that reason, the mesh depth is set to 1.\
In 3D simulation data, voxel and mesh spacing will be the same because voxel and mesh depth is the same.

```python
mcds.get_mesh_spacing()  # [30.0, 20.0, 1]
mcds.get_voxel_spacing() # [30.0, 20.0, 10.0]
mcds.get_voxel_volume()  # 30[nm] * 20[nm] * 10[nm] = 6000[nm\*\*3]
```

Since version 3, coordinate labels are distinct:
+ **x,y,z:** stand for cell position coordinates, and are real values.
+ **m,n,p:** stand for mesh center coordinates, and are real values.
+ **i,j,k:** stand for voxel index coordinates, and are unsigned integer values.

For a better understanding, let's fetch start and stop range values for each coordinate type.\
Unlike in the python range function, not only the start value, but also the stop value is inclusive.

```python
mcds.get_voxel_ijk_range()  # [(0, 10), (0, 10), (0, 0)]
mcds.get_mesh_mnp_range()  # [(-15.0, 285.0), (-10.0, 190.0), (0.0, 0.0)]
mcds.get_xyz_range()  # [(-30.0, 300.0), (-20.0, 200.0), (-5.0, 5.0)]
```

The domain benchmarks are:
+ voxel index values stretch from 0 to 10 longitude (i), 0 to 10 latitude (j), the 2D domain is only 1 voxel deep (k).
+ mesh center values stretch from -15[nm] to 285[nm] longitude (m), -10[nm] to 190[nm] latitude (n), and the depth mesh center (p) is at zero.
+ cells can hold a positioned between -30[nm] and 300[nm] longitude (x), -20[nm] and 200[nm] latitude (y), and -5[nm] and 5[nm] depth (z).

For voxel and mesh centers, we can fetch the axis tick lists.\
Each of this function will return a list of 3 numpy arrays, ordered by ijk or mnp, respective.

```python
mcds.get_voxel_ijk_axis()
mcds.get_mesh_mnp_axis()
```

We can even retrieve all mnp mesh center coordinate triplets, and the meshgrids in 2D or 3D shape itself.\
The coordinate triplets are returned as numpy array.\
The meshgrids are returned as a 3 way tensor (2D) or 4 way tensor (3D) numpy array. \
As shown below, it is easy to subset these tensors.

```python
# all mnp coordinates
mnp_coordinats = mcds.get_mesh_coordinate()  # numpy array with shape (3, 121)
mnp_coordinats.shape  # (3, 121)

# 2D mesh grid
mn_meshgrid = mcds.get_mesh_2D()  # numpy array with shape (2, 11, 11)
mn_meshgrid.shape # (2, 11, 11)
m_meshgrid = mn_meshgrid[0]  # or explicit mn_meshgrid[0,:,:]
n_meshgrid = mn_meshgrid[1]  # or explicit mn_meshgrid[1,:,:]
m_meshgrid.shape  # (11, 11)
n_meshgrid.shape  # (11, 11)

# 3D mesh grid
mnp_meshgrid = mcds.get_mesh()  # numpy array with shape (3, 11, 11, 1)
mnp_meshgrid.shape # (3, 11, 11, 1)
m_meshgrid = mnp_meshgrid[0]  # or explicit mnp_meshgrid[0,:,:,:]
n_meshgrid = mnp_meshgrid[1]  # or explicit mnp_meshgrid[1,:,:,:]
p_meshgrid = mnp_meshgrid[2]  # or explicit mnp_meshgrid[2,:,:,:]
m_meshgrid.shape  # (11, 11, 1)
n_meshgrid.shape  # (11, 11, 1)
p_meshgrid.shape  # (11, 11, 1)
```

Furthermore, there are two helper function.\
One to figure out if a particular xyz coordinate is still in side the mesh, another one to translate a xyz coordinate into ijk voxel indices.\
The translation function will by default checks if the given coordinate is in the mesh.

```python
# is given xyz is in the mesh?
mcds.is_in_mesh(x=0, y=0, z=0)  # True
mcds.is_in_mesh(x=111, y=22, z=-5)  # True
mcds.is_in_mesh(x=111, y=22, z=-5.1)  # False and Warning @ pyMCDS.is_in_mesh : z = -5.1 out of bounds: z-range is (-5.0, 5.0)

# translate xyz into ijk!
mcds.get_voxel_ijk(x=0, y=0, z=0)  # [0,0,0]
mcds.get_voxel_ijk(x=111, y=22, z=-5)  # [4, 2, 0]
mcds.get_voxel_ijk(x=111, y=22, z=-5.1)  # None and Warning @ pyMCDS.is_in_mesh : z = -5.1 out of bounds: z-range is (-5.0, 5.0)
```


#### Microenvironment (Continuum Variables) Data

Let's have a look at the substrate.\
We can retrieve an alphabetically ordered list of all substrates processes in the simulation.\
In the loaded dataset, only one substrate, oxygen, was part of the simulation.

```python
mcds.get_substrate_names()  # ['oxygen']
```

We can retrieve a pandas dataframe with the parameters (decay\_rate, diffusion\_coefficient) that were set for each substrate.

```python
df = mcds.get_substrate_df()
df.head()
```

Regarding the concentrations, we can retrieve:
+ a **numpy array** of all substrate concentrations at a particular xyz coordinate, ordered alphabetically by substrate name, like the list retrieved by the get\_substrate\_names function.
+ substrate specific 3D or 2D **meshgrid numpy arrays**.
  To get a 2D meshgrids you can slice though any z stack value, the function will always pick the closest mesh center coordinate, the smaller coordinate, if you hit the saddle point between two voxels.
+ **matplotlib contour and contourf plots**, for any substrate, through any z\_slice.
+ a **pandas dataframe** with voxel ijk coordinate values, mesh center mnp coordinate values, and concentrations values for all substrates.

```python
# all concentration values at a particular coordinate
mcds.get_concentration_at(x=0, y=0, z=0)  # array([34.4166271])
mcds.get_concentration_at(x=111, y=22, z=-5)  # array([18.80652216])
mcds.get_concentration_at(x=111, y=22, z=-5.1)  # None and Warning @ pyMCDS.is_in_mesh : z = -5.1 out of bounds: z-range is (-5.0, 5.0)

# concentration meshgrid for a particular substrate
oxygen_3d = mcds.get_concentration('oxygen')
oxygen_2d = mcds.get_concentration('oxygen', z_slice=0)
oxygen_3d.shape  # (11, 11, 1)
oxygen_2d.shape  # (11, 11)

# contour plot
fig = mcds.get_contour('oxygen')
fig = mcds.get_contour('oxygen', z_slice=3.333)
fig.show()

# dataframe with complete voxel coordinate (ijk), mesh coordinate (mnp), and substrate concentration mapping
df = mcds.get_concentration_df()
df.head()

# detect substrates that not over whole domain have the same concentration
df = mcds.get_concentration_df(states=2)
df.head()  # oxygen concentration varies over the domain
```


#### Cell (Discrete Cells) Data

Now, let's have a look at all variables we track from each agent.\
It is quite a list.\
This list is ordered alphabetically, except for the first entry, which always is ID.

```python
mcds.get_cell_variables()  # ['ID', 'attachment_elastic_constant', ..., 'velocity_z']
len(mcds.get_cell_variables())  # 77
```

The data itself we can retrieve as dataframe.\
There exist two functions to do so.\
One that retrieves data from all agents in the whole domain, the other retrieves only data from the agents in a particular voxel, specified by the xyz coordinate.\
Please note, this dataframes not only hold the exact xyz coordinate, and all discrete variables mentioned above, they list additionally all agent surrounding substrate concentrations, the containing ijk voxel coordinate, and the mnp mesh center coordinate.

```python
# data from all agents in the domain
df = mcds.get_cell_df()
df.shape  # (992, 94)  this means: 992 agents in the whole domain, 94 tracked variables
df.info()
df.head()

# data variables that are in all agents the same carry no information
# let's filter for variables that carry at least 2 states
df = mcds.get_cell_df(states=2)
df.shape # (992, 38) this means: 992 agents in the whole domain, 38 tracked variables have more than 2 states

# data from all agents in the xyz specified voxel
df = mcds.get_cell_df_at(x=0,y=0,z=0)
df.shape  # (4, 94)

df = mcds.get_cell_df_at(x=111,y=22,z=-5)
df.shape  # (3, 94)

df = mcds.get_cell_df_at(x=111,y=22,z=-5.1)  # None and Warning @ pyMCDS.is_in_mesh : z = -5.1 out of bounds: z-range is (-5.0, 5.0)
```

Additionally, there is a scatter plot function available, shaped for df\_cell dataframe content.
```
# scatter plot
fig = mcds.get_scatter()  # default focus is cell_type and z_slice=0
fig.show()

fig = mcds.get_scatter('oxygen', z_slice=3.333)
fig.show()
```


Since lately, PhysiCell tracks for each cell, if this cell touches other cells.\
This data is stored in two dictionaries of sets of integers which link the corresponding cell IDs.\
We have here a closer look at the neighbor graph because the attached graph is in this particular study not really interesting.

```python
# attached graph
graph = mcds.get_attached_graph_dict()
len(graph)  # 992

# neighbor graph
graph = mcds.get_neighbor_graph_dict()
len(graph)  # 992
graph.keys()  # dict_keys([0, 1, ..., 993])
graph[0]  # {1, 31, 33, 929, 935, 950}
```


#### Units

Finally, it is possible to retrieve a pandas series that lists all units from all tracked variables, from metadata, mesh, continuum\_variables, and discrete\_cells.

```python
se = mcds.get_unit_se()
se.shape  # (82,)
se.name  # 'unit'
se.index  # Index(['attachment_elastic_constant', 'attachment_rate', ..., 'velocity_z'], dtype='object', name='feature')
se.head()
```


#### MCDS Time Steps, Pandas, and Plotting

Since microenvironment data and cell data can be retrieved as pandas datafarme, basic plotting (line plot, bar plot, histogram, boxplot, kernel density estimation plot, area plot, pie plot, scatter plot, hexbin plot) can easily be generated with the **pandas plot function**.
As mentioned above, for microenvironment data, the TimeStep class has a mcds.get\_contour function because pandas has no contour and contourf plots implementation.
All these plots are **mathplotlib** plots, hence fine tuning can always be done using the matplotlib library.

+ https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.plot.html
+ https://matplotlib.org/

```python
# load library
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# set constantes
z_slice = 0

# generate plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(7,4))

# plot microenvironment
mcds.get_contour('oxygen', z_slice=z_slice, ax=ax)

# plot cells
df = mcds.get_cell_df()
df = df.loc[(df.mesh_center_p == z_slice),:]
df.plot(
    kind = 'scatter',
    x = 'position_x',
    y = 'position_y',
    s = 10,
    c = 'oncoprotein',
    cmap = 'magma',
    vmin = 0,
    vmax = 2,
    grid = True,
    title = 'cells and microenvironment',
    ax = ax,
)
ax.axis('equal')
plt.tight_layout()

# save plot to file
# bue 20230101: note, in this test dataset, cells were seeded outside the actual domain.
fig.savefig('pymcds_2d_cell_and_microenvironment.png', facecolor='white')
plt.close()
```


#### Transform an MCDS Time Step into an AnnData Object

The [AnnData](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) format is the de facto standard for single cell data analysis in python.\
It is a one-liner to transform a mcds object onto an anndata object.\
This is the gate to a whole new universe.

+ https://scverse.org/

```python
ann = mcds.get_anndata()
print(ann)  # AnnData object with n_obs × n_vars = 1099 × 80
            #     obs: 'ID', 'current_phase', 'cycle_model'
            #     obsm: 'spatial'
```

The output tells us that we have loaded a time step  with 1099 cells (agents) and 80 features.
And that we have spatial coordinate annotation (position\_x, position\_y, position\_z, time) of the loaded data.

Whatever you d'like to do with your physicell data, it most probably was already done with single cell wet lab data.
That's being said: PhysiCell data is different scdata than scRNA seq, for example.
scRNA seq data is higher dimensional (e.g. for the human genome, over 20000 genes each time step) than PhysiCell data (tens, maybe hundreds of features).
scRNA seq data is always single time step data because the measurement consumes the sample.
PhysiCell data is always time series data, even we look at this moment only at one time step.
This all means, the wet lab bioinformatics will partially try to solve problems (e.g. trajectory inference), that simply are no problems for us and the other way around.

Anyhow, the gate is open.
For the shake of appearances, let's do a cluster analysis on PhysiCell output using scanpy.

```python
import scanpy as sc

# loads only feature that have not the same value in all cells.
# max absolute scales the features into a range between -1 and 1.
ann = mcds.get_anndata(states=2, scale='maxabs')

# principal component analysis
sc.tl.pca(ann)  # process anndata object with the pca tool.
sc.pl.pca(ann)  # plot pca result.
ann.var_names  # list the numerical features we have at hand (alternative way: ann.var.index).
ann.obs_keys()  # list the categories features we have at hand (alternative way: ann.obs.columns).
sc.pl.pca(ann, color=['current_phase','oxygen'])  # plot the pca results colored by some features.
sc.pl.pca(ann, color=list(ann.var_names)+list(ann.obs_keys()))  # gotta catch 'em all!
sc.pl.pca_variance_ratio(ann)  # plot how much of the variation each principal component captures.

# neighborhood graph clustering
sc.pp.neighbors(ann, n_neighbors=15)  # compute the neighborhood graph with the neighbors preprocess step.
sc.tl.leiden(ann, resolution=0.01)  # cluster the neighborhood graph with the leiden tool.
sc.pl.pca(ann, color='leiden')  # plot the pca results colored by leiden clusters.

# umap dimensional reduction embedding
sc.tl.umap(ann)  # process anndata object with the umap tool.
sc.pl.umap(ann, color=['current_phase','oxygen','leiden'])  # plot the umap result colored by some features.
```


### Working With MCDS Time Series in Python3

An exciting thing about modeling is to have time series data.\
Pcdl's TimeSeries class is here to make the handling of a time series of MCD snapshots easy.

```python
import pathlib  # library to locate the test data
import pcdl  # the physicell data loader library

s_path = str(pathlib.Path(pcdl.__file__).parent.joinpath('data_timeseries_2d'))  # local path to the installed test data set
print('mcds time series:', s_path)

# generate a mcds time series instance
mcdsts = pcdl.TimeSeries(s_path)
```

Like in the pyMCDs class, for memory consumption and processing speed control, we can specify if we want to load microenvironment data and graph data from the snapshots we later on analyze.\
By default, all data related to the snapshot is loaded, if needed, we can set load to False.\
Additionally, we can exclude to read the PhysiCell\_settings.xml file, if it is not available, and fine tune variable typing.

```python
# fine tuned the way mcds objects will be loaded
mcdsts = pcdl.TimeSeries(s_path, custom_type={}, load=True, microenv=False, graph=False, settingxml=None)
```


#### MCDS Times Series Data Analysis - the Basics

Now, let's have a look at the TimeSeries instances data analysis functions.

```python
# fetch data
mcdsts = pcdl.TimeSeries(s_path, load=False)
```

+ **get_xmlfile_list** will simply return a list of absolute path and mcds xml file name strings.\
This list can be manipulated, and later be fed into the objects read\_xml function, to only read specific snapshots into memory.
For example, if you want only to analyze hour 11, 12, and 13 from your run, or if data from every other hour will be enough.

```python
ls_xml = mcdsts.get_xmlfile_list()
ls_xml   # ['/path/to/output00000000.xml', '/path/to/output00000001.xml', ..., '/path/to/output00000024.xml']

# filter for snapshot 11,12, and 13
ls_xml_11_12_13 = ls_xml[11:14]
ls_xml_11_12_13  # ['/path/to/output00000011.xml', '/path/to/output00000012.xml', '/path/to/output00000013.xml']

# filter for every other snapshot
ls_xml_even = [s_xml for i, s_xml in enumerate(ls_xml) if (i%2 == 0)]
ls_xml_even  # ['/path/to/output00000000.xml', '/path/to/output00000002.xml', ..., /path/to/output00000024.xml']
```

+ **read_xml** will actually read the snapshots into RAM.\
The default setting will read all snapshots from a time series. \
However, you can always use a filtered ls\_xml list to only load a subset of snapshots.

```python
# load all snapshots
mcdsts.read_mcds()
mcdsts.get_mcds_list()  # YMMV! [<pcdl.pyMCDS.pyMCDS at 0x7fa660996b00>, <pcdl.pyMCDS.pyMCDS at 0x7fa67673e1d0>, ..., <pcdl.pyMCDS.pyMCDS at 0x7fa660950f10>]
len(mcdsts.get_mcds_list())  # 25

# load snapshot 11, 12, and 13
mcdsts.read_mcds(ls_xml_11_12_13)
len(mcdsts.get_mcds_list())  # 3

# load all even snapshots
mcdsts.read_mcds(ls_xml_even)
len(mcdsts.get_mcds_list())  # 13
```

Single snapshots can now be accessed by indexing.\
With a single snapshot, you work exactly in the same way as with an object loaded by TimeStep.

```python
# get the simulation time
mcdsts.get_mcds_list()[12].get_time()  # 720.0

# get the cell data frame
df = mcdsts.get_mcds_list()[12].get_cell_df()
df.shape  # (992, 87)
df.head()
```

It is very easy to loop over the whole time series, to analyze time series data, and generate time series plots.

```python
# load library
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# fetch data
mcdsts = pcdl.TimeSeries(s_path)

# loop over the time series to gather temporal information like, for example, data for a growth curve
lr_time = [mcds.get_time() for mcds in mcdsts.get_mcds_list()]  # [0.0, 60.0, ..., 1440.0]
li_cellcount = [mcds.get_cell_df().shape[0] for mcds in mcdsts.get_mcds_list()]  # [889, 898, ..., 1099]

# pack data into a pandas datafarm
df = pd.DataFrame([lr_time,li_cellcount], index=['time_min','cell_count']).T
df.head()

# plot data
df.plot(
    kind = 'scatter',
    x = 'time_min',
    y = 'cell_count',
    s = 36,
    ylim = (800,1200),
    grid=True,
    title='2D time series test data'
)

# save plot to file
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
df.plot(
    kind = 'scatter',
    x = 'time_min',
    y = 'cell_count',
    s = 36,
    ylim = (800,1200),
    grid = True,
    title = '2D time series test data',
    ax = ax,
)
plt.tight_layout()
fig.savefig('pymcdsts_2d_cellcount.png', facecolor='white')
plt.close()
```


#### Times Series Data Scatter Plot Images, Contour Plot Images, and Movies

With PhysiCell it is not only possible to take data snapshots, but as well [svg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG) vector graphics images snapshots.\
PhysiCell's [Makefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)) has code to translate those svg images into [gif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF), [jpeg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG), [png](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics), or [tiff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIFF) format, making use of the [image magick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageMagick) library.
The Makefile also has  code to translate the jpeg, png, or tiff images into a [mp4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP4_file_format) movie, therefore utilizing the [ffmpeg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFmpeg) library.\
TimeSeries instances provide similar functionality, although the jpeg, png, and tiff images are generated straight from data and not from the svg files.
However, mp4 movies and gif images are generated in the same way.
This means the mcdsts.make\_gif code will only run if image magick and mcdsts.make\_movie code will only run if ffmpeg is installed on your computer.

```python
# fetch data
mcdsts = pcdl.TimeSeries(s_path)
```

Translate physicell output data into static raster graphic images:

```python
# cell images colored by cell_type
mcdsts.make_imgcell()  # jpeg images colored by cell_type
mcdsts.make_imgcell(ext='png')  # png images colored by cell_type
mcdsts.make_imgcell(ext='tiff')  # tiff images colored by cell_type

# cell images can be colored by any cell dataframe column, like, for example, by pressure
# there are parameters to adjust cell size and more
mcdsts.make_imgcell(focus='pressure')  # jpeg images colored by pressure values

# substrate data owns an equivalent function,
# being able to display any substrate dataframe column
mcdsts.make_imgconc(focus='oxygen')  # jpeg images colored by oxygen values
```

Translate raster graphic images into a dynamic gif image:\
Gif images can only be generated for already existing jpeg, png, or tiff images!\
By default, jpeg files will be used, to generate the gif.\
If png or tiff files should be used as source, then this has to be explicitly stated.

```python
# using jpeg images for input
s_path = mcdsts.make_imgcell()
mcdsts.make_gif(s_path)

# using jpeg images one-liner
mcdsts.make_gif(mcdsts.make_imgcell())

# using tiff images for input
s_path = mcdsts.make_imgcell(ext='tiff')
mcdsts.make_gif(s_path, interface='tiff')
```

Translate raster graphic images into an mp4 movie:\
Movies can only be generated for already existing jpeg, png, or tiff images!

```python
# using jpeg images for input
s_path = mcdsts.make_imgcell()
mcdsts.make_movie(s_path)

# using jpeg images one-liner
mcdsts.make_movie(mcdsts.make_imgcell())

# using tiff images for input
s_path = mcdsts.make_imgcell(ext='tiff')
mcdsts.make_movie(s_path, interface='tiff')
```


#### MCDS Times Series Data Triage

Cell variables that have no variance, zero entropy, that are in all agent overall time steps in the same state, have always exacted the same value, carry no information.
Similarly, substrates variables that over the whole domain overall time steps have the same concentration are not interesting.

```python
# fetch data
mcdsts = pcdl.TimeSeries(s_path)
```

There are functions to help triage over the entier time series for features that more likely might carry information, by checking for variables with variation.
```
# cell data min max values
dl_cell = mcdsts.get_cell_df_states()  # returns a dictionary with all features, listing all accessed states
len(dl_cell)  # 84 features
dl_cell.keys()  # list feature names
dl_cell['oxygen']  # list min and max oxygen values found, surrounding a cell, over the whole series

# cell data number of states
di_state = {}
[di_state.update({s_feature: len(li_state)}) for s_feature, li_state in mcdsts.get_cell_df_states(allvalues=True).items()]
di_state['oxygen']  # cell surrounding oxygen was found occupying 2388 different states (values) over the whole time series

# substrate data
dl_conc = mcdsts.get_conc_df_states()
dl_conc.keys()  # list feature names
dl_conc['oxygen']  # list min and max oxygen values found in the domain over the whole series
```


#### Transform MCDS Time Series into AnnData Objects

```python
# fetch data
mcdsts = pcdl.TimeSeries(s_path)
```

A mcds time series can be translated into one single anndata (default).
```python
ann = mcdsts.get_anndata(states=2, scale='maxabs', collapse=True)
print(ann)  # AnnData object with n_obs × n_vars = 889 × 26
            #     obs: 'z_layer', 'time', 'current_phase', 'cycle_model'
            #     obsm: 'spatial'
```
The output tells us that we have loaded a time series with 24758 cell (agent) snapshots and 27 features.
And that we have spatial coordinate annotation (position\_x, position\_y, position\_z, time) of the loaded data.

A mcds time series can be translated into a chronological list of anndata objects, where each entry is a single time step.
After running get\_anndata, you can access the objects by the get\_annmcds\_list function.
```python
l_ann = mcdsts.get_anndata(states=2, scale='maxabs', collapse=False)
len(l_ann)  # 25
l_ann[24]  # AnnData object with n_obs × n_vars = 1099 × 79
           #     obs: 'z_layer', 'time', 'cell_type', 'current_death_model', 'current_phase', 'cycle_model'
           #     obsm: 'spatial'

# load all snapshots
mcdsts.get_annmcds_list()  # YMMV! [AnnData object with n_obs × n_vars ..., ..., ... obsm: 'spatial']
len(mcdsts.get_annmcds_list())  # 25
```


### Data Clean Up

After you are done checking out the results, you can uninstall the test datasets and all files stored within its folders.

```
pcdl.uninstall_data()
```


**That's all Folks!**
