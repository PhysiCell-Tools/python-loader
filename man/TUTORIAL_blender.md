# PhysiCell Data Loader Tutorial: pcdl and Blender

[Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is a modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing,  motion tracking, video editing, and game creation software.
Blender is free and open source.
There exists a vtk nodes plugin, that lets us load <!-- vtk rectilinear grid data, -->vtk polynomial data files.
And there exists a bioxel nodes plugin, that lets us load ome tiff files.


## &#x2728; Handle vtk files

The blender bvtk nodes plugin allows us to load vtk files into blender.

Note, to be able to load whole time series, the blender bvtk nodes plugin needs a simplified output00000000.vtp file name and extension (which is different from the pcdl default output00000000\_cell.vtp).
This is why the ext parameter explicitly has to be set.

### Generate vtk files from the command line

```bash
pcdl_make_conc_vtk output
```
```bash
pcdl_make_cell_vtk output --ext .vtp  # generate blender bvtk nodes compatible filename and extension!
```

### Generate vtk files from within python

```python
import pcdl

mcdsts = pcdl.TimeSeries('output/')
mcdsts.make_conc_vtk()
mcdsts.make_cell_vtk(ext='.vtp')  # generate blender bvtk nodes compatible filename and extension!
```

### Blender vtk nodes plugin installation

This installation is not for the faint hearted!
Please follow the bvtk nodes installation instructions,
including workspace setup.

### Load vtk polynomial data vtk files

1. In the BVTK Node Tree Workspace, click New to add a Node Tree
2. In the BVTK Node Tree Workspace, right click Add / Reader / vtkXMLPolyDataReader
3. In the BVTK Node Tree Workspace, right click Add / Converters / VTKtoBlenderMesh
4. Connect tkXMLPolyDataReader output with input VTKtoBlenerMesh
5. tkXMLPolyDataReader FileName: path/to/output00000000.vtp
6. VTKtoBlenderMesh: click Update Node

### Load vtk polynomial data vtk files as a time course

Special thank to Danyon Gedris from the Stein-O'Brien Lab, who figuring all of this out!

1. In the BVTK Node Tree Workspace from the previous section, right click Add / Custom / TimeSelector.
2. Connect vtkXMLPolyDataReader output with input TimeSelector.
3. Connect TimeSelector output with input VTKtoBlenderMesh.
4. In the BVTK Node Editor, press N to open the sidebar.
5. Select the Inspect tab and change: Update Mode → Update All Automatically.
6. Click update node on each element in the BVTK Node Editor and force update upstream on VTKtoBlenderMesh.
7. Set your scene frame range to:
+ Start = 1 (this selects output00000000.vtp).
+ End = # of .vtp files in the sequence (the last output file number plus 1).
8. Press play on the animation.

### Load rectilinear grid vtk files

I was not able to bridge that data yet.

<!-- Geometry nodes could be part of the solution,
but I would have to write such a converter.

## &#x2728; Handle ome tiff files

The blender bioxel nodes plugin allows us load single time step ome tiff files into blender.

### Generate ome tiff files from the command line

```bash
pcdl_make_ome_tiff output --collapse false
```

### Generate ome tiff files from within python

```python
import pcdl

mcdsts = pcdl.TimeSeries('output/')
mcdsts.make_ome_tiff(collapse=False)
```

### The blender bioxel nodes plugin

Please follow the official bioxel nodes instructions for installation
and to learn how to use the plugin.

That's it! The rest is analysis within blender!
